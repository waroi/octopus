A: Octopus is an AI-powered code review tool that connects to GitHub and Bitbucket, indexes your codebase for deep context, and automatically reviews every pull request — posting findings as inline comments with severity levels.

Q: How does the automated review work?
A: When a pull request is opened, Octopus fetches the diff, retrieves relevant context from your indexed codebase using vector search, and sends it to an LLM (Claude or OpenAI) for analysis. Findings are posted directly on the PR with severity ratings: Critical, Major, Minor, Suggestion, and Tip.

Q: Which programming languages are supported?
A: Octopus is language-agnostic. It reviews any text-based code file — TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, and more.

Q: Is my source code safe?
A: Yes. Your code is processed in-memory and never stored permanently. Only vector embeddings are persisted for search. You can also self-host Octopus.

Q: Does Octopus replace human reviewers?
A: No. Octopus augments your team's review process. It catches bugs, security issues, and style inconsistencies so your human reviewers can focus on architecture, design decisions, and business logic.

Q: Is there a free tier?
A: Yes! Every organization gets free credits to start. You can also bring your own API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cohere) to avoid credit costs entirely.`,

A: Octopus is an open-source, AI-powered code review tool that indexes your codebase and automatically reviews pull requests with context-aware findings.

Q: How does Octopus review code?
A: When a PR is opened, Octopus fetches the diff, retrieves relevant code context via vector search, and uses an LLM (Claude or OpenAI) to analyze changes. Findings are posted as inline PR comments.

Q: What languages does Octopus support?
A: Octopus is language-agnostic. It supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Scala, C, C++, Vue, Svelte, Astro, HTML, CSS, SQL, GraphQL, and more.

Q: How is Octopus different from human reviewers?
A: Octopus augments human review. It catches bugs, security issues, and style problems so humans can focus on architecture and design.

Q: How is Octopus different from linters?
A: Linters check syntax and formatting rules. Octopus understands your entire codebase context, catches logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and provides architectural feedback.`,

A: Your code is processed in-memory and never stored permanently. Only vector embeddings are persisted.

Q: Can I self-host Octopus?
A: Yes. Octopus is fully self-hostable with Docker. Your code never leaves your infrastructure.

Q: Which AI models are used?
A: Claude (Anthropic) and OpenAI GPT-4o for reviews and chat. OpenAI text-embedding-3-large for embeddings. Cohere rerank-v3.5 for search re-ranking.

Q: Is my code used for AI training?
A: No. Neither Anthropic nor OpenAI use API inputs for training. Your code is never used to train AI models.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Integrations",
        text: `Q: Which Git platforms are supported?
A: GitHub and Bitbucket. More platforms are planned.

Q: Does Octopus work with Slack?

Q: Does Octopus integrate with Linear?
A: Yes. Create Linear issues directly from review findings with one click.

Q: Does Octopus support monorepos?
A: Yes. Octopus indexes the entire repository including all packages in a monorepo.

Q: Is there a CLI?
A: Yes. Install with npm install -g @octp/cli. Use it to review PRs, chat with your codebase, and manage knowledge.`,

A: Yes. Every organization gets free credits. No credit card required.

Q: Can I use my own API keys?
A: Yes. Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Cohere. No credits consumed.

Q: How do spend limits work?
A: Set a monthly cap per organization. Operations are paused when the limit is reached.`,
      },

        heading: "Technical",
        text: `Q: How does codebase indexing work?
A: Octopus clones your repo, chunks code files into 1500-character segments with 200-character overlap, creates embeddings using text-embedding-3-large, and stores them in Qdrant for vector search.

Q: What is the Knowledge Base?
A: A collection of custom documents (guidelines, architecture decisions, coding standards) that Octopus references during reviews to enforce your team's specific rules.

Q: How long does a review take?
A: Most reviews complete in under 2 minutes, depending on the size of the diff and the amount of context retrieved.

Q: Can I customize reviews?
A: Yes. Upload knowledge documents, configure .octopusignore to exclude files, choose your AI provider, and set severity thresholds.

Q: How do real-time updates work?
A: Octopus uses WebSocket connections (via Pubby SDK) to push real-time updates: review progress, chat messages, indexing status, and team activity.`,

        heading: "Terms",
        text: `BYO Keys (Bring Your Own Keys): Use your own API keys for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or Cohere instead of Octopus credits. Configure in organization settings.

Codebase Indexing: The process of cloning a repository, splitting code into chunks, creating vector embeddings, and storing them in Qdrant for semantic search.

Context Window: The maximum amount of text an LLM can process in a single request. Octopus manages context by retrieving only the most relevant code chunks via vector search.

Credits: The unit of currency in Octopus. AI operations (reviews, chat, indexing) consume credits. Free credits are provided; additional credits can be purchased.

Diff: The set of changes in a pull request — lines added, modified, or removed. Octopus analyzes the diff against full codebase context.

Embeddings: Numerical vector representations of text. Octopus uses OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (3072 dimensions) to create embeddings of code chunks for semantic search.

Knowledge Base: Custom documents uploaded to an organization (coding guidelines, architecture decisions, style guides) that Octopus references during reviews.

LLM (Large Language Model): AI models like Claude (Anthropic) and GPT-4o (OpenAI) that analyze code and generate review findings.

.octopusignore: A file in your repository root (same syntax as .gitignore) that tells Octopus which files to skip during indexing and review.

Qdrant: The vector database used by Octopus to store and search code embeddings. Collections: code_chunks, knowledge_chunks, review_chunks, chat_chunks, flowchart_chunks.

Reranking: A second-pass ranking step using Cohere rerank-v3.5 that re-orders search results by relevance to the query, improving the quality of retrieved context.

Severity Levels: Finding priority ratings — 🔴 Critical (must fix), 🟠 Major (should fix), 🟡 Minor (nice to fix), 🔵 Suggestion (consider), 💡 Tip (informational).

Spend Limit: A monthly cost cap per organization. When reached, AI operations are paused until the next billing cycle or limit increase.

Vector Search: Semantic search using embeddings. Instead of keyword matching, vector search finds code that is semantically similar to the query, even with different wording.

Webhook: An HTTP callback from GitHub or Bitbucket that notifies Octopus when events occur (PR opened, PR updated, push). This triggers automatic reviews.`,
